A package for print pdf files from default printer.



How to run this API 

node printOperation.js

After running this command above both pdf files are printed by your defualt printer connected to your system.

So use node-printer API and enjoy the moment.

I am also waiting for your contribution to make it more effective.


Note: In this API we have to use SumatraPDF.exe so special thanks to SumatraPDF for providing us to use without any cost.
